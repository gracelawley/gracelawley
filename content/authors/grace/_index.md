Hi! I am a PhD student in the Computer Science & Engineering program at [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/) in Portland, Oregon, USA.

My interests include computational linguistics, speech & language disorders, houseplants, and Rachmaninoff. My research involves developing computational methods to detect and quantify atypical word use in the language of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
