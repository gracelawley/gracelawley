## Research

---
class: middle

### My Current Research

Characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
    
  + Restricted, repetitive interests
  
  + Difficulties with social communication

--

.fancy[Pedantic speech]

  + Overly formal, adult-like speech
  
  + Using conventional words and phrases in unusual and peculiar ways
  
  + Jill Dolata's example:
    
    + "I ate shrimp for lunch"
    
    + "I ate crustaceans for lunch"
  
---
class: middle

### How is this currently measured?

#### Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS)
  
  + Standard ASD assessment tool
  
  + Series of semi-structured, examiner led activities
  
  + Coding scheme for behaviors characteristic of ASD 

--
  
  + Pedantic speech:
  
  > Use of words or phrases tends to be more repetitive or .look[formal] than that of most individuals at the same level of expressive language, but not obviously odd...

--

#### Limitations

* Subjective, inconsistent across examiners 

* Based on observational reports from parents/teachers/clinicians

---
class: middle

### Alternatives?

* Could try to develop an automated method to quantify this
    * ...but capturing something so subtle will be difficult

* How can you teach a computer to differentiate "I ate shrimp from lunch" from "I ate crustaceans for lunch?"

* Lots of different ways to be pedantic
  + Vocabulary choice
  + Style of speaking
  + Tone

* Usually want to smooth outliers, but in this case the outliers are the points we are interested in

## What can we use these for?

class: middle

### Q: How _much_ do they talk?

--

One way to measure this $\rightarrow$ .fancy[Mean Length of Utterance (MLU)]

* MLU = average number of morphemes per utterance for a sample of 100 utterances

* As a typically developing child gets older, they will produce longer and more complex utterances

* Used as a measure of expressive language, language productivity, and language development

  + _Expressive language_ is language used to communicate, while _receptive language_ is the ability to understand language
  
  + All else being equal, a higher MLU reflects a higher level of language proficiency


---

### MLU in Language Development


__Brown's Stages of Syntactic and Morphological Development__ <sup> 1,2 <sup>

|Stage|Age (months)|MLU|Example Utterances|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|I|12 - 26|1.0 - 2.0| "that car" <br> "more juice"|
|II|27 - 30|2.0 - 2.5| "it going" <br > "in box" <br> "my cars"|
|III|31 - 34|2.5 - 3.0| "man's book" <br> "was it Alison?"|
|IV|35 - 40|3.0 - 3.75| "the puppy chews it" <br> "a ball on the book" |

### Q: How _repetitive_ are they being?

--

One way to measure this $\rightarrow$ .fancy[Type-Token Ratio (TTR)]

* Can talk a lot while not really saying much 

  + e.g. "row row row your boat..."

* $\text{ttr} = \frac{\text{# unique words}}{\text{total # words}}$

* Measures degree of lexical variation

  + A higher TTR reflects a more diverse vocabulary

  + If someone says a lot but is very repetitive they will have a lower TTR

* $\text{tf-idf} = \text{tf}(term, doc) \times \text{idf}(term)$
  
  + $\text{idf}(term) = ln(\frac{n_{\text{documents}}}{n_{\text{documents containing term}}})$

  + Term frequency = frequency of $t$ in $d$ 
  
  + Inverse document frequency = how "important" $t$ is across all documents
  
+ Identifies the words that are used a lot in a document but are not too common overall

  + Words that are frequently used across all documents will have a _lower_ tf-idf value while words that are rarely used overall will have a _higher_ tf-idf value

### The data I have to work with

* Transcribed conversations (n = 254) between an examiner and a child

```


---

### First, text preprocessing

  + Convert all letters to lowercase
  
  + Remove all coded words - e.g. "xxx and I went to the park"
  
  + Remove all punctuation except apostrophes (keep contractions as is - e.g. "don't" vs. "do not")
   
  + Tokenize into unigrams

.emphasize[Hypothesis:] 

Using infrequent/uncommon words $\rightarrow$ pedantic speech

.emphasize[Approach:]

1. Create a document matrix where a document corresponds to a participant
  
2. Use a transformed frequency value: $\log(\frac{n_{word}}{n_{total words}} +1)$ 
  
3. Explore dimensionality reduction methods to reduce dimensions of term-document matrix down to 2 dimensions
  
4. Visualize results
