I am a Computer Science & Engineering PhD candidate at [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/) in Portland, Oregon, USA. My advisor is [Dr. Steven Bedrick](https://www.bedrick.org/). My research involves developing computational and statistical methods to detect and quantify different aspects of the language of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). I am expecting to graduate by the end of 2023. 

I am also a Data Science Mentor at [Posit](https://posit.co/) (previously known as RStudio) for [Posit Academy](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/academy/). I mentor small groups of working professionals as they develop and hone their data science skills in R or Python.
