Hi! My name is Grace Lawley. I am a second-year PhD student in the [Computer Science & Electrical Engineering (CSEE)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/basic-science-departments/csee/) program at the [Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/center-for-spoken-language-understanding/) at [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/) in Portland, Oregon.

I graduated from Lewis & Clark College in 2017 with a B.A. in Mathematics. My interests include discrete math, data science, computational linguistics, Rachmaninoff, pottery, and the programming languages Python & R.

My research involves developing computational methods to detect and quantify atypical word use in the language of children with autism. Currently, I am working on compiling a childrenâ€™s speech corpus to use in my research. This endeavor has lead to me diving head first into the field of corpus linguistics, where I have been learning about the various methods for the compilation and normalization of spoken corpora.
