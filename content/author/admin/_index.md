Hi! My name is Grace Lawley. I am a third-year PhD student in the Computer Science & Engineering program at the [Center for Spoken Language Understanding (CSLU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/research/centers-institutes/center-for-spoken-language-understanding/) at [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/) in Portland, Oregon.

My interests include computational linguistics, speech & language disorders, houseplants, and Rachmaninoff. My research involves developing computational methods to detect and quantify atypical word use in the language of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
