abstract: "Figuring out how to put theory into practice is not always straightforward. Real world data, especially natural language data, can put up quite the fight. In this talk, I will share my experience learning how to apply the lessons I learned in undergraduate math courses to medical research on the language of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Topics I will touch on include: natural language processing, data science, modeling, and dimensionality reduction."
abstract_short: "Tales of my transition from math proofs to natural language research at Oregon Health & Science University."
