Hi! I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science & Engineering program at [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/) in Portland, Oregon, USA. My advisor is [Dr. Steven Bedrick](https://www.bedrick.org/).

My interests include computational linguistics, speech & language disorders, statistics, and houseplants. My
research involves developing computational methods to detect and quantify different aspects of the language of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
