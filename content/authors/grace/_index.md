I am a PhD candidate in the Computer Science & Engineering program at [Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU)](https://www.ohsu.edu/xd/) in Portland, Oregon, USA. My advisor is [Dr. Steven Bedrick](https://www.bedrick.org/). My research involves developing computational methods to detect and quantify different aspects of the language of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). 

I am also a Data Science Mentor at [Posit Academy](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/academy/) (Posit was previously known as RStudio). I mentor small groups of working professionals as they develop and hone their data science skills using either R or Python. I also assist the Academy content development team in translating and adapting prior course material from R into Python.

<!---My interests include computational linguistics, speech & language disorders, statistics, and houseplants.-->
